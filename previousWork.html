                    Students will become familiar with the language 
                    and operating system environment used in most 
                    upper division courses in the Computer Science 
                    major curriculum. Use of the file system, operating- 
                    system calls, and shell-level programming; low-level 
                    debugging of high-level programs. Programming exercises
                    will include applications from data structures (e.g. 
                    B-trees) and memory management techniques.

                    This class will introduce various web languages, 
                    libraries, frameworks, and techniques and cover the 
                    spectrum of skills required to become a web developer. 
                    In this course, students will begin by learning HTML, 
                    CSS, and JavaScript. By the end of this course students 
                    will be able to describe the structure and functionality 
                    of the web, create dynamic web applications using a 
                    combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deploy 
                    those applications for all to see.
