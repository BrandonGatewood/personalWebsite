# personalWebsite

This project is my personal website that displays my accomplishments as a student and developer. 
I have deployed my personal webisite with GitHub Pages. 
To run the code, you can use the Live Server extension on vs code, or open any .html file with a browser.

I used Material.io to help develop the theme of my website and makeuseof.com to make my dropdown navbar for mobile devices.
